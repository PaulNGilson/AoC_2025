# Advent of Code 2025

My attempt at the 12*2 challenges from the [2025 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenge.

I'd like to continue where I left off last year, so here are essentially the same
aims I had last time:

* No help from friends/colleagues/Reddit/etc. - I need to work out a solution on
  my own to all the challenges.
* I can do any _non-Advent of Code_ research I like, from looking up potential
  algorithms, studying bits of mathematics, snippets from Stack Overflow, etc.
  * _Edit: other than Python library documentation, I didn't need to do any
    additional research this year._
* No AI.
* Final solutions should run in sub-15s and I'll rework where I can to make that
  happen, but accept it probably won't be possible for all 12 days.

| Days | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Stars | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time | 35 | 29 | 32 | 129 | 38 | 39 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

:star: means just the first star, :star2: means both stars, and :custard: (just
because "custard" showed up while searching for emojis with "star" in the name)
means no stars and the day is in the past. I suspect I'll be very behind the
daily-rate, as the days get busier through December...

Times to run are just one example run, in milliseconds (unless specified
otherwise).

## Updates

While completing the challenges, I was trying to keep performance to a "good"
level - not just sub-15s, but as optimal as I could manage, on my own. Notes on
this are below:

* Day 2: optimisation wasn't exactly necessary from the first solution, but it
  was a lot of fun looking for a way to not have to inspect everything and
  looking for shortcuts. Pleased with the eventual outcome and timing!
